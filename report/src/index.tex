\section{Introduction}

% Describe your project background, motivation, and goals in detail.
\subsection{Abstract}
Many stores use point of sale (POS) systems to manage their inventory and sales.
These systems help store owners track sales and manage their inventory. These
are often touch-operated devices that also give the option of using a mouse
pointer or keyboard shortcuts. They consist of purpose-built machines running
proprietary, often custom-built, software.

Due to this proprietary nature, these systems are often expensive and are costly
and time consuming to update. This incurs higher maintenence costs on businesses
ityand a higher workload on employees due to the unreliabile of outdated software and hardware.

\subsection{Project Stakeholders}
Potential project stakeholders would include any physical retailer with the
desire to use this software. The goal is to design the software such that it can
be adapted to be used in any setting, offering a decent amount of customization. Although, the main
target audience, in the beginning, will be traditional storefront retailers.

\section{Project Requirements Specification}

Include the following:


\subsection{Use Cases}

The major use cases of this software is to facilitate retail transactions at the
point of sale. This requires secure interation with a backend database, requires
of the frontend to support multiple input methods such as touch, pointer, and keyboard.
Since the end goal of this project is to be a near drop-in replacement for any
existing point of sale system, we intend on using standard communication protocals
between every component of the system. We also intend on implementing a form
of administration privilages, that can be accessed by passcode on any
frontend machine.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Core Application Requirements}\par

  \begin{center}
    \textbf{Security}\\
    \begin{tabular}{|c | c |}\hline
      Description & The app must contain a system to verify users in a secure\\
      & manner, and to process payments into the database without posing a security\\
      & threat to the customer. \\ \hline
      Source & Collaberatively decided properties of a point-of-sale system among\\
      & the development team. \\ \hline
      Priority & Priority 0: Core to functionality of application \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \vspace{2em}

    \textbf{Item Database}\\
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}\hline
      Description & The backend of the app must contain a reletively simple item\\
      & database that keeps track of at least each item's UPC(universal product code),\\
      & the price, and the quantity in stock. This database must be connected remotly\\
      & to each instance of the frontend, with updates being sent both ways. \\ \hline
      Source & Collaberatively decided properties of a point-of-sale system among\\
      & the development team. \\ \hline
      Priority & Priority 0: Core to functionality of application \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \vspace{2em}

    \textbf{Multi-headed frontend with privilage levels}\\
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}\hline
      Description & The frontend of the app must be able to have multiple instances\\
      & running simultaniously, each sending updates to a central backend machine.\\
      & This front end also must be able to make use of different privilage levels\\
      & in order to support the level of employee organization that matches the\\
      & environment this machine is designed to run in. \\ \hline
      Source & Collaberatively decided properties of a point-of-sale system among\\
      & the development team. \\ \hline
      Priority & Priority 0: core to functionality of application \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}


  \end{center}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

\textbf{Security}\\
The ability for the system to be able to securely process transactions is highly\\
important. Although the frontend will be a web-based implementation, the system\\
deploying the frontend will remain offline, save for a secure connection to the backend\\
which is what processes all the data.\\
\textbf{Intuitivness}\\
The goal is to create a User Interface that the user does not need to be told\\
how to use. Labeled buttons and baking in support for multiple different common\\
input standards is key to this operation.\\
\textbf{Flexibility}\\
Due to the web-based nature of the platform, the application should be able to be\\
deployed on a wide variety of hardware, eliminating the need for expensive, proprietary\\
point-of-sale machines.
\subsection{Standards}

We aim to be compliant with several standards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item W3C WCAG, which regulates accessibility
    \item GDPR, which regulates consumer privacy
    \item PCI DSS, which regulates how to securely handle financial information
\end{itemize}


\section{Software Design - Solution Approach}

% This section should describe the final design of your software system.

% Please review these sections and make the necessary updates to reveal
% the changes in your project design since your revision.

As this section as a whole is designed to be a more comprehensive
overview of the software design, it is fitting to restate the project goals.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create an flexible, secure, web-based frontend, minimizing downtime
  due to updates.
  \item Create a secure backend, capable of frequently communicating with all frontend
  terminals over the air.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Architecture Design}

% Include Section II from your Solution Approach report here. Provide the
% block diagram of your architecture and give a brief description of it.

\subsubsection{Overview}

% This section should describe the overall architecture of your software.
% The architecture provides the top level design view of a system and
% provides a basis for more detailed design work.

The system that is created is one which accomodates the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Inventory Management
  \item  Payment Management
  \item  Transaction Management
\end{itemize}

Following these requirements, the system will take on a Client-Server
Archetecture, with the backend acting as a server, and the multiple
POS terminals acting as its clients.\par
This system has many benefits, including
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Safety. If multiple terminals all need to keep track of their
  own databases, in seperate instances, it increases the difficulty and
  risk of miscounting and other data errors. When numbers are centralizd,
  and updated in a queue, or other safe data structure, this risk decreases significantly.
  \item Flexibility. Any number of these terminals can be added, with no
  downside.
  \item Simplicity. A POS terminal does not need specilized hardware and software,
  only a network connection, and a modern internet browser. Updates can also be handled
  over the air, and updates to the software can be server-side.
\end{enumerate}

To describe an example of an implementation, you could have a server, say a desktop
running mongoDB through rust, communicating with many terminals, which could be android or otherwise,
a lightweight linux locked down into a browser environment, which holds the frontend app,
programmed in Svelte script.

This portion of the document will be updated with details further, as the project is built.
\subsubsection{Subsystem Decomposition}

This section explains how you decomposed your system into subsystems.

\subsection{Data design}

Describe all data structures (including the internal and temporary data
structures), and the database(s) created as part of the application.

\subsection{User Interface Design}

% Provide a detailed description of user interface. The information in
% this section should be accompanied with proper images of your software's
% GUI.

% The emphasis of this section should be on the design decisions of your
% GUI rather than the final design. You will explain your final GUI in
% detail in section VI (Description of Final Prototype). Please avoid
% redundancy as much as possible in these two sections.


The first screen the user will see is the login screen. Here the user can log in
to his account; no other pages can be accessed until the user is logged in.

Once the user is logged in, he is presented with the main screen. The main
screen is the checkout screen, where items can be scanned in to be included in
the transaction.

At the top of the main screen is a info bar containing information, such as the
time, logged in user, and other relevent information. At one end of the bar,
there is a menu containing some options: log out, user profile, etc. If the
logged in user has admin rights, there will also be an option to go to the admin
settings page.

The bulk of the main page shows the items that are to be purchased, including
name, quantity and price. At the bottom of this view, there will be a line
showing the total price and quantity.

At the bottom of the main page there will be another menu, this time for typical
actions that would occur during checkout. These include a check out button, a
reset transaction button, a text box to enter product codes (one would normally
use a barcode scanner to provide the input), a button to find a product by name,
and anything else needed.

When the ``check out'' button is pressed, the program enters the check out
screen. Here a total will be displayed, complete with tax and any other charges.
There will be buttons for the different payment methods: cash, check, or card.
Pushing ``cash'' will open a popup which allows the user to enter the cash
recieved, and tell how much change to give. Pressing ``check'' will open a
similar popup to record the check details. Pressing ``card'' will open a similar
menu, which will either allow you to enter the card details, or interface with a
physical card reader.

After one of these buttons is pressed and the transaction is complete, the
program returns to the main screen.


Images will come soon.

\subsection{Constraints}

Software engineering design is a process of devising a system,
component, or process to meet desired needs and specifications within
constraints. It is an iterative, creative, decision-making process in
which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are
applied to convert resources into solutions. Software engineering design
involves identifying opportunities, developing requirements, performing
analysis and synthesis, generating multiple solutions, evaluating
solutions against requirements, considering risks, and making
trade-offs, for the purpose of obtaining a high-quality solution under
the given circumstances.

Constraints vary by project. Examples of possible constraints include
aesthetics, codes, constructability, cost, ergonomics, extensibility,
functionality, interoperability, legal considerations, maintainability,
manufacturability, marketability, policy, regulations, schedule,
sustainability, or usability.

\section{Test Case Specifications and
Results}

\subsection{Testing Overview}

Include a summary of your test objectives and test plans.

Describe the overall approach to testing and provide the overall flow of
the testing process. An example is provided in an Appendix.

Are you using Continuous Integration (CI) and/or Continuous Delivery
(CD) in your testing? What tools are you using, what kinds of testing do
they provide? Unit tests, integration, system, user interface,
speed/non-functional requirement testing, user testing, etc.

In all of these major categories, include at least some material about
your implementation, how it is currently executing, and/or what future
work would be needed to ensure it happens for this project

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Unit testing
\item
  Integration testing
\item
  System testing
\item
  Functional testing
\item

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{ Environment
Requirements}{ Environment Requirements}}

Specify both the necessary and desired properties of the test
environment. The specification should contain the physical
characteristics of the facilities, including the hardware, the
communications and system software, the mode of usage (for example,
stand-alone), and any other software or supplies needed to support the
test. Identify special test tools needed.

\subsection{Test Results}

Include your prototype test results from your ``Test Case Specifications
and Results'' document as updated with your current project status.

\end{longtable}

\section{Description of Final
Prototype}

In this section provide a \textbf{\ul{detailed}} description of your
final prototype.

(If applicable) Include a brief user manual for your final software
where you provide step by step instructions for using your system.
Explain the major use case scenarios. You may include screenshots of the
user interface.

\ul{Describe your final prototype implementation. Please format this
section according to what you think is the best way to describe your
prototype. The following is just a suggestion.}

I recommend to include plenty of images and pictures of the following
where appropriate:

- any diagrams/figures that visualize various features of your
prototype;

- the screenshots of your user interfaces;

- the screenshots of your test programs;

- pictures of your team testing and debugging the devices, programs,
etc.

A well-thought and clear diagram is better than long and descriptive
text.

If your document starts to be very long due to screenshots and diagrams,
please put at least some of them into an appendix to this document.

\section{Social Responsibility and Broader Impacts}

Social responsibility: identify informed judgements that you made for
this project based on legal and ethical principles. Discuss if those
judgements are in line with your responsibilities as a computing /
software / cyber engineer. If not, what prompted you to make judgements
that are contradictory to your professional responsibilities?

Broader impacts: highlight how your work aligns with the WSU EECS's
goals of benefiting society and broadening participation in STEM.
Describe not only how your project addressed a real-world problem
(briefly state the problem) but also emphasized accessibility,
inclusivity, and/or educational outreach. If you engaged with local
communities through user testing and feedback sessions, mention that. If
you collaborated with multiple teams from various departments or groups,
mention that. If you documented your project and released it freely to
support open-source missions, mention that. If your project outcomes
contribute to technological innovation and provide a foundation for
future student-led research, community-based applications, mention that.

\section{Product Delivery Status}

When was/will the project be delivered to your client? Was it
demonstrated and who did you hand it off to?

Also include project location information here. This is for both the
instructor and your client as future reference. This should include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Source repositories
\item
  Equipment storage location - where did you leave any client or course
  materials
\item
  Any other materials needed to rebuild your project from the ground up
\end{enumerate}

Ensure that either here or in your detailed description you include any
instructions or where the instructions are to install and setup your
project so future users know where to start.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{Limitations and
Recommendations}

Include a brief description of the limitations of your current prototype
that you are aware of, and discuss possible solution approaches to
overcome those limitations.

Please keep the discussion brief. 1 page text should be sufficient for
this section.

Note that there might be overlap between the Limitations and
Recommendations section and the Future Work section. ``Future Work''
should discuss the possible ways to extend the project, where as
``Limitations and Recommendations'' should be more detailed and should
discuss the problems and missing features in the final prototype and
should describe the possible solution approaches.

\subsection{Future Work}

Include a conclusion and discuss the future work. Future work should
include discussion on how to extend this project. For those of you who
are self or EECS sponsored, discuss commercialization possibilities.
